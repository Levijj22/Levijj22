### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an SSW Account Manager based in Sydney, Australia.

I specialize in Business Development and Account Management, working with the SSW sales team to promote and advance the growth of our NSW clientele. My drive for business development and technology fuels me, and I thrive on problem-solving with my "out of the box" mindset.

I will be actively involved in the initial stages of your new project, conducting an initial meeting to discuss your company's requirements and assessing which of our brilliant developers are best suited to your project. At this stage, a team of talented developers and I work together to build a plan for the project ahead, which we call the Specification Review. Following this, using the Specification Review outcome as a roadmap, our top-tier Solution Architects will guide the production team through the new solution, every step of the way. I will continue to ensure the project is running smoothly and that communication is flowing freely.

In my free time, I love to travel and explore new places around the world, immersing myself in different cultures and cuisines. I'm also fascinated by the potential of AI and enjoy utilizing the power of ChatGPT. Additionally, I am a passionate car enthusiast and find the process of assembling and testing engines both challenging and rewarding.
